                <p>Anatomy of a Piece is a Digital Humanities project that seeks to explore how secondhand fashion empowers fashion conscious Gen-Z and, through sharing the results, inspire other Gen-Z to give secondhand fashion a chance too! Our name, “Anatomy” of a “Piece,” is a reference to how secondhand fashion items, be it thrifted, vintage, or passed onto you by friends or family, are embedded with a multitude of stories and metaphorically carry within them the history. For instance, the same button-down shirt can be styled in dramatically different ways depending on the personal style of different owners. Finally, in addition to this project site which houses our secondhand item archive, we also have an Instagram page, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anatomyofapiece?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">@anatomyofapiece</a>. Within it we share posts emphasizing sustainability and inclusivity with the intention of breaking down the stigma around secondhand shopping.</p>
